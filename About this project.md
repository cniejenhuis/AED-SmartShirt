Rehabilitation and exercise, in general, are very popular and efficient ways to keep our bodies fit and healthy, prevent injuries but also to recover from them. It is crucial to sustain a correct form during these exercises to benefit from them and not hurt ourselves. The smart shirt addresses this problem and aims to help people exercise correctly by recording and evaluating data from resistive knitted textile sensors integrated into the shirt and giving haptic feedback in real-time and visualising data for the user, physiotherapist, or coach.To monitor upper body movements in physiotherapy, it is important to continuously track the orientation of the arms during the performed exercises. We used different types of sensors to measure these movements.
